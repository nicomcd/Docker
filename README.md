# [Docker & Kubernetes: The Practical Guide [2024 Edition]](https://www.udemy.com/share/103IaC3@5G0-SQ_L9ghBhMFLdnkrUZJAl7q2eUVI4A234q8Y8LLcBmRGKWcDhkGKGDXmx6wVEA==/)

I'm currently utilizing this course from Udemy created by Maximilian Schwarzmüller, here is the following description for the course if anyone would also like to take it! 

Docker & Kubernetes are amongst the most in-demand technologies and topics you can learn these days. Because they significantly simplify the development and deployment process of both simple and complex software projects. 
For modern DevOps (Development Operations) but also for local development - on your own or in a team - this is a winner feature since you will no longer have any "but it worked on my machine" discussions. It works inside of a container, hence it works everywhere!

We'll explore all key concepts in detail and with practical examples and demos - from images and containers, over volumes and networking all the way up to deployment and Kubernetes Cluster.

## In detail, this course includes the following topics:
- A thorough introduction to Docker, containers and why you might want to use Docker
- Detailed setup instructions for macOS and Windows
- A deep-dive into the core concepts you need to know: Containers & images
- Learn how to create custom images, use existing images and how to run containers based on such images
- Get a detailed overview of the core commands you need when working with Docker
- Learn how to work with data and how to persist data with volumes
- Explore container networking - with the outside world and between multiple containers
- Learn how to work with both single and multi-container projects
- In-depth deployment instructions: Manual deployment and deployment with managed services like AWS ECS
- Understand Kubernetes core concepts & architecture
- Learn how to create Kubernetes resources, deployments, services and how to run your containers with Kubernetes
- Dive deeply into working with data in Kubernetes projects - with different types of volumes
- Kubernetes networking and DNS service discovery
- Learn how to deploy your Kubernetes project (at the example of AWS EKS)

All these topics are taught in great detail with slides and theory but also, most importantly, with many examples and demo!

## What you’ll learn
- Learn what Docker and Kubernetes are and why you might want to use them
- Learn how to install and use Docker on any system (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- Learn how to create and use Images & Containers with Docker
- Understand complex topics like managing and persisting data with Volumes
- Learn about Container Networking with Docker Networks and DNS Service Discovery
- Learn how to deploy Docker applications - manually, with managed services or with Kubernetes
